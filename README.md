# Match.edu: Matching You With a Research Advisor 👨🏻‍🏫

Applying for graduate school is exhausting, finding the right research advisor takes a lot of time and effort. The useful information is scattered across multiple websites. For example, professors' research areas may be listed on the departments' websites. But at the same time, professors usually have their own personal websites. There are also websites of research groups and labs that they are in. Gathering all these information together requires a lot of human work and time. Luckily, our team came up with the idea of building a website to help ease that process.

To use our app, the user will need to register for an account first. The user will also need to fill in some basic information like name, school, email, research interests, etc. Our app will provide the functionalities for students to upload their resumes and papers for professors to view. Registered users can search for professors by name, school, department and research areas. Our app will also be able to recommend professors to students with aligned research interests.
